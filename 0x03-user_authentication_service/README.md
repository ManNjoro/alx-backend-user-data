# User authentication service
This service provides a secure and scalable way to authenticate users for your application. It uses a combination of industry-standard protocols and best practices to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the authentication process.
### How it works

The user authentication service works by following a simple three-step process:

1. **The user enters their credentials.** This can be done through a variety of methods, such as a username and password, a social media login, or a biometric scan.
2. **The service verifies the credentials.** The service checks the user's credentials against a database of stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, the user is authenticated.
3. **The service generates an access token.** The service generates an access token that is used to identify the user during subsequent requests. This access token is typically stored in a cookie or in the user's browser's local storage.
